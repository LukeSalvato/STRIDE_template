## STRIDE_project_template
Setting up a template repository to manage STRIDE projects

The purpose of this project is detect patterns of land-use change in the CA central valley, and to look for relationships with climate
My hypothesis is not yet determined.

I plan to collect data from USDA-NASS and Landsat and PRISM (climate data). 


Any file or script added to this repository will be added or linked out to storage location from one of the following components:
* Data management plan file (explains how data are to be organized, stored and shared)
* get_raw_data folder (scripts to get the data and a link to the storage of the directly downloaded data with no cleaning)
* analyze_data folder (scripts for any transformation of the raw data and links to the resulting processed dataset )
